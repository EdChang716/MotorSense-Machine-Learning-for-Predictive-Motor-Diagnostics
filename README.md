# MotorSense-Machine-Learning-for-Predictive-Motor-Diagnostics
MotorSense leverages machine learning models (SVM, KNN, DNN, XGBoost) for real-time motor malfunction diagnosis. It uses advanced data preprocessing and embeds AI into systems to predict failures early, reducing downtime and maintenance costs in industrial processes.
